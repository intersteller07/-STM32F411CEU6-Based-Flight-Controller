STM32F411CEU6 Based Flight Controller
Welcome to the STM32F411CEU6 Drone build! 
I'm thrilled to present an open-source initiative aimed at unleashing the full potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using the STM32F411CEU6 microcontroller.

Before we start, I would like to thank INAV for providing the Flight configurator which made the more of an ease.

About INAV Flight Configurator:
iNav (inavflight) is an open-source firmware designed for the navigation and control of multirotors, fixed-wing aircraft, and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It is based on the well-known Betaflight firmware but tailored for the unique requirements of GPS-assisted navigation and autonomous flight. Here's a brief overview of iNav Flight:

Features:
1. GPS Navigation:
iNav supports GPS modules to enable features such as Return-to-Home (RTH), waypoint navigation, and position hold.
2. Return-to-Home (RTH):
Automatic RTH capability allows the UAV to return to its takeoff location in case of signal loss or low battery.
3. Waypoint Navigation:
iNav enables the setting of waypoints for autonomous navigation, making it suitable for aerial surveying or exploration missions.
4. Altitude and Position Hold:
The firmware can maintain a specific altitude and position using the information from onboard sensors and GPS.
5. Barometer and Magnetometer Support:
iNav supports barometers and magnetometers for accurate altitude and heading information.
6. Fixed-Wing Support:
In addition to multirotors, iNav supports fixed-wing aircraft, providing a versatile solution for various aerial platforms.
7. On-Screen Display (OSD):
OSD integration allows real-time telemetry data to be displayed on the pilot's FPV goggles or monitor.
8. Mission Planning:
iNav is compatible with mission planning tools, allowing users to define complex flight plans before takeoff.
9. Telemetry and Blackbox Logging:
Telemetry support provides real-time information to the ground station, and Blackbox logging helps analyze and troubleshoot flight performance.
10. Configurability:
iNav offers a high level of configurability through its user-friendly interface, enabling users to tune parameters according to the specific requirements of their aircraft.
